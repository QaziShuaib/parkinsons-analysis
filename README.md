### According to wikipedia:
Parkinson's disease (PD), or simply Parkinson's, is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system.
The symptoms usually emerge slowly, and as the disease worsens, non-motor symptoms become more common. 
The most obvious early symptoms are tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking.
Cognitive and behavioral problems may also occur with depression, anxiety, and apathy occurring in many people with PD.

### About Dataset:

### My Model:
I have made a Machine Learning Model using the famous Xgboost Algorithm.
This model predicts the possiblity of Parkinsons disease in a person, according to the data.
